LORE Open Expression License (LOEL)

Version 1.0 — 2025-05-07Derived from principles of the Copyfarleft (C4) License, adapted for tabletop and digital roleplaying content.

Preamble

The Lightweight Open Rules Engine (LORE) and all associated written materials, expressions, and mechanics are released into the creative commons of roleplaying games. This license guarantees that LORE remains a tool for all — forever usable, modifiable, and extendable — while preventing its enclosure within proprietary systems.

LORE does not claim ownership over game mechanics (which are not copyrightable), but it does claim this license over all expression of those mechanics, including:

Written rules

Descriptive text

Class and race writeups

Spells, abilities, and items

Naming conventions and terminology

Examples, flavor text, formatting, and rule expressions

Terms

1. Freedom to Use and Modify

You may use, copy, modify, remix, and adapt any material licensed under the LORE Open Expression License for personal, educational, or commercial purposes.

2. Share-Alike (Copyleft)

Any derivative works must be released under this same license (LOEL v1.0 or a future-compatible version). You may not add additional restrictions, DRM, or proprietary clauses to any part of LORE-derived material.

3. No Enclosure

You may not relicense, incorporate, or adapt LORE content into any system or project that:

Converts LORE content into Product Identity (PI), trademarked elements, or protected brand expressions.

Obscures, encrypts, or restricts user access to the source of the expressions.

Prevents others from further modifying and sharing the content.

4. Attribution Requirement

All public distributions must credit “LORE RPG” and list contributing authors where appropriate.

For example:“This game uses and extends the LORE RPG system. LORE is released under the LORE Open Expression License. Learn more at [link-to-be-added].”

5. Perpetual and Irrevocable

This license is irrevocable. The content released under LOEL cannot be withdrawn from the commons. Future versions of LORE may be licensed under newer versions of LOEL, but previously released versions remain under this license.

6. Logo Use

The LORE logo is released under the same terms as this license. It may be used freely in any derivative, compatible, or community-created work that also honors the LOEL. Users may not:

Use the logo to falsely imply official endorsement or authorship.

Alter the logo in misleading ways.

Use the logo in works that violate the Share-Alike or No Enclosure principles.

Use of the logo in this context signifies support for and alignment with the LORE commons.

7. Digital and Interactive Use

LORE content may be freely used in digital, virtual tabletop, and video game contexts under the same Share-Alike terms. Any game, app, or software incorporating LORE content or mechanics must:

Release all expressive content (text, names, UI rulesets, story frameworks) under LOEL.

Allow users reasonable access to the LORE-based content (e.g., via modding tools, exportable data, plaintext formats).

Not include DRM, anti-user modification systems, or legal restrictions incompatible with LOEL.

You are encouraged to build, expand, and gamify LORE content in any digital form, provided the spirit and letter of this license are honored.

8. Logo Files and Downloads

Two official LORE SVG logo files are provided:

A standalone LORE wordmark

A version where LORE appears inside an open book

These are released under the same LOEL license and may be used in:

Rulebooks, modules, digital games, apps, or compatible works

Community projects that align with the LOEL's terms

You must not:

Trademark or register these logos

Use them to imply official endorsement unless authorized

Modify them in misleading ways

Legal Notes

LOEL is not a software license; it governs expressive content in roleplaying systems.

This license is not affiliated with Creative Commons, but follows similar principles to CC BY-SA.

If any portion of this license is found unenforceable in a given jurisdiction, the remainder shall remain in effect.

Summary (Plain Language)

You can use this. For anything.

You can remix this. Build on it however you like.

You must share it. If you build something with LORE, keep it open.

You must credit it. Don’t pretend you made it all yourself.

You cannot lock it up. No DRM, no walled gardens, no trademarks on LORE content.

You can use the logo. But only if you play by the same open rules.

You can make games with it. But they have to stay open too.

LORE belongs to everyone. Treat it that way.
